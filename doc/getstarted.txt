The Turtle

The turtle is the green triangle in the middle of the screen. 

You can use the turtle to draw pictures by giving it *commands*. A command is a word followed by *parameters* such as how far to move or turn.

Try this: 

  forward 100<enter>

The turtle will move forward, drawing a line. 

*FORWARD* is the command that makes the turtle move forward. It can be shortened to *FD*. The *100* is the argument that tells the turtle how many steps to move.

Try this:

  back 50<enter>

The turtle will move back half way along the line.

*BACK* is the command that makes the turtle move backward. It can be shortened to *BK*. The *50* is the argument that tells the turtle how many steps to move.

Try this:

  right 90<enter>
  fd 50<enter>

The turtle will turn to the right and move forward 50 steps.

*RIGHT* is the command that makes the turtle turn to the right. It can be shortened to *RT*. The *90* is the argument that tells the turtle how far to turn.

Try this:

  left 180<enter>

The turtle will turn face back the way it came.

*LEFT* is the command that makes the turtle turn to the left. It can be shortened to *LT*. The *180* is the argument that tells the turtle how far to turn.

Try this:

  fd 100<enter>

The turtle will move foward 100 steps.

Try this:

  rt 135<enter>
  fd 71<enter>
  rt 90<enter>
  fd 71<enter>

The turtle will draw two more lines.

Try this:

  penup<enter>
  fd 71<enter>

The turtle will move but won't draw a line. 

*PENUP* is the command that tells the turtle to lift the pen. It will not draw a line again until you give it the *PENDOWN* command.

PENUP can be shortened to *PU* and PENDOWN can be shortened to *PD*.

Try this:

  pendown<enter>
  rt 90<enter>
  fd 71<enter>

The turtle will draw another line.

Try this:
 
 rt 45 fd 100 rt 45 fd 71 rt 135 fd 200<enter>

You can put more than one command on each line.
